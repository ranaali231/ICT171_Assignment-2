Week 1: Launching the Server and Initial Setup.
In week one, I started with creating an AWS account via AWS Educate and learning how to use AWS Management Console. I explored different services, then EC2 and created a virtual machine with Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS, a stable, long term supported operating system. I opted for t2.micro, an eligible service under AWS’s free tier, with basic server settings. I created a new .pem key pair, one I would have to use on a secured basis. When creating the instance, I modified security group settings to permit incoming traffic on SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443). To ensure my instance was running, I then SSH connected into it by entering into where my .pem file was residing and entering SSH command AWS gave. I logged into my Ubuntu server. To get my environment ready, I updated system cached packages with sudo apt update then went ahead with Apache’s install with sudo apt install apache2. I checked for installation via a visit into my instance’s public IP address in a webpage, where I was welcomed with Apache’s welcome page a confirmation my web server was live and functional.

Week 2: Elastic IP and LAMP Stack Configuration.
Week 2 was spent making a public facing server ready for dynamic data. First, I assigned an Elastic IP (EIP) address to the instance. As a result, the public IP address no longer changed on reboot, losing no accessibility. Next, I went ahead with LAMP. PHP, required Apache PHP module, and PHP MySQL driver were installed via sudo apt install php libapache2 mod php php mysql. Next, I went ahead with the installation of MySQL server using sudo apt install mysql server. Post installation, I accessed MySQL as a root, set a different authentication plugin as mysql native password, and created a strong pass. Next, I created a new MySQL username (m_ali) as well as a database (m) solely for use by WordPress. Full permissions on the new database were assigned for this new username. This completed the server/config part, with the server ready for dynamic fetch/storing of data with WordPress.

Week 3: Deploying WordPress and Initial Configuration.
Week three, I deployed a complete WordPress site on my Apache server. I switched directories to /tmp on the server and downloaded a fresh version of the WordPress package with wget. I extracted the package using tar, then transferred the WordPress directory into Apache's document root at location /var/www/html/. There, I copied in the sample config file into wp-config.php and edited it with database credentials and modifications to get it working with MySQL. I then established proper permissions, accessed the site using the server’s public IP address with a suffix of /wordpress, which presented me with the WordPress install page. I completed the install using the browser-based interface, and as a precaution, also updated wp-config.php manually in case automatic file writing fails. That finished off the install, and I could then access the WordPress admin interface and begin basic customizations and config of content.

Week 4: Domain Integration and HTTPS Security.
I set up a custom domain and secured my site last week. I purchased a custom domain, named foodone.xyz, from Namecheap. I set A records in Namecheap’s control panel under Advanced DNS for mapping the root domain (@) and www subdomain to my EC2’s Elastic IP address. Back on my server, I edited Apache virtual host config in /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf to set a ServerName with my domain. I also made two additions in wp-config.php with WP_HOME & WP_SITEURL with my URL from a domain. Following an Apache restart as well as a wait for DNS propagation, my site was accessible over my domain. Lastly, I set up Certbot to activate HTTPS. Following a resolution of an initial repo issue, I was able to install Certbot with Apache plugin with ease, then executed sudo certbot --apache to obtain a free SSL certificate from Let’s Encrypt. The tool automatically configured Apache to serve HTTP on HTTPS. Testing with a visit in browsers using https://foodone.xyz presented me with a secure padlock icon—indicating that SSL was properly functional as well as my site was fully secured.
